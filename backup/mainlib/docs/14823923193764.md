国际友人版权

早上[胸毛](http://www.lyzane.com/)的博客有一[国际友人](http://www.zoltanhosszu.com/)留言：

I would love if you didn't steal my design. This is not for sale, it was developed and designed by myself and you are not allowed to use it.

当时胸毛正在用的博客皮肤就是来自该国际友人的设计，原作者找上门来了。V 在移植修改的时候没有联系上原作者，不过 footer 部分是加了原作者的链接的。

D刚联系了国际友人，邮件如下：

Hi, Zoltán.

I am the main author of the blogging program 'B3log Solo', I am very sorry to hear about:

I would love if you didn't steal my design. This is not for sale, it was developed and designed by myself and you are not allowed to use it.

To respect the original designer of this theme, we had listed you at the footer part of the theme.

The blogging program is an open source project hosted at Google Code (http://code.google.com/p/b3log-solo), and it totally free to everybody, 
I wish you can contribute this design to us, could you? Maybe you can join our team to make some wonderful designs for more peoples.

If you even stick to it, we will remove this theme since the next release (Feb 19, 2012) of B3log Solo.

Anyway, thank you ;-)

希望他能同意我们使用，不然这个皮肤要下线了 ;-(

另一面，也请在中国混 IT 的同僚们再次注意：虽然我们是在中国，但不要忽视版权。
